# Hotel Reservation Analysis in SQL and Tableau

In this project, I explored a hotel reservation dataset to identify interesting patterns and trends that could inform business strategies and decision-making.


## Objective
The aim of this project was to work with a hotel reservation dataset that contains information about reservations at two types of hotels: Resort Hotels (H1) and City Hotels (H2) using SQL for data manipulation and Tableau for visualization to gain insights and create impactful visualizations.


## Tools
- SQL (MySQL)
- Tableau
- GitHub


## High-level Steps
**1. Data Import:**
- Import the hotel reservation dataset into MySQL environment.

**2. Data Exploration:**
- Explore the dataset to understand the variables and the relationships between them.

**3. SQL Analysis:**
- Use SQL for data manipulation and analysis.

**4. Tableau Visualization:**
- Create visualizations in Tableau based on my findings from the SQL analysis.

**5. GitHub Repository:**
- Maintain a GitHub repository with all my scripts, code, and visualizations.

**6. Tableau Dashboards publishing:**
- Publish my Tableau dashboards for easy access and sharing.

**7. Presentation:**
- Prepare a presentation or report summarizing my findings and recommendations.
